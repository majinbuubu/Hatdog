            <p class="tit">Trees</p>

            <p class="auth">By Joyce Kilmer</p>

            <p>I think that I shall never see<br>
            A poem lovely as a tree.</p>

            <p>A tree whose hungry mouth is prest<br>
            Against the earthâ€™s sweet flowing breast;</p>

            <p>A tree that looks at God all day,<br>
            And lifts her leafy arms to pray;</p>

            <p>A tree that may in Summer wear<br>
            A nest of robins in her hair;</p>

            <p>Upon whose bosom snow has lain;<br>
            Who intimately lives with rain.</p>

            <p>Poems are made by fools like me,<br>
            But only God can make a tree.</p>

            <p class="tit">From a Railway Carriage</p>

            <p class="auth">By Robert Louis Stevenson</p>

            <p>Faster than fairies, faster than witches,<br>
            Bridges and houses, hedges and ditches;</p>

            <p>Charging along like troops in a battle<br>
            All through the meadows the horses and cattle:</p>

            <p>All of the sights of the hill and the plain<br>
            Fly as thick as driving rain;</p>

            <p>And ever again, in the wink of an eye,<br>
            Painted stations whistle by.</p>

            <p>Here is a child who clambers and scrambles,<br>
            All by himself and gathering brambles;</p>

            <p>Here is a tramp who stands and gazes;<br>
            And here is the green for stringing the daisies!</p>

            <p>Here is a cart run away in the road<br>
            Lumping along with man and load;</p>

            <p>And here is a mill, and there is a river:<br>
            Each a glimpse and gone forever!</p>

            <p class="tit">Now We Are Six</p>

            <p class="auth">By A. A. Milne</p>

            <p>When I was One,<br>
            I had just begun.<br>
            When I was Two,<br>
            I was nearly new.<br>
            When I was Three<br>
            I was hardly me.<br>
            When I was Four,<br>
            I was not much more.<br>
            When I was Five,<br>
            I was just alive.<br>
            But now I am Six,<br>
            I'm as clever as clever,<br>
            So I think I'll be six now for ever and ever.</p>

            <p class="tit">The Rainbow</p>

            <p class="auth">By Christina Rossetti</p>

            <p>Boats sail on the rivers,<br>
            And ships sail on the seas;<br>
            But clouds that sail across the sky<br>
            Are prettier far than these.</p>

            <p>There are bridges on the rivers,<br>
            As pretty as you please;<br>
            But the bow that bridges heaven,<br>
            And over tops the trees,<br>
            And builds a road from earth to sky,<br>
            Is prettier far than these.</p>
